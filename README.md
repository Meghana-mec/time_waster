> **"Because wasting time is an art form."**  
> Built to derail your day—on purpose.

## 🎯 What Is This?

**TimeWaster** is not a website. It's an engineered **dopamine funnel** that asks you how much time you want to waste — then serves you a perfectly matched YouTube video.  
⚠️ Warning: Extremely low productivity ahead.

---

## 🧠 Why You'll Keep Coming Back

This site is crafted using **addiction-grade design principles** used in apps like TikTok, YouTube, and Candy Crush — all under the hood of a "useless project."

### ✅ **Color Psychology**
- Dark theme + Neon punch  
- Comfortable for doomscrolling at 2 AM

### ✅ **UI/UX Laws Used**
- **Hick's Law**: Only 1 decision to make. Fast dopamine.
- **Zeigarnik Effect**: Unfinished loops → video loading → anticipation.
- **Von Restorff Effect**: Irregular colors. Pattern interrupts. You won't scroll past.

### ✅ **Pattern Interrupt System™**
> "WASTE MY TIME!" – A button that shouldn't feel this good to click.

---

## 🕹 How It Works

1. You type how long you want to waste.
2. The app says: "Finding the perfect waste of time..."
3. A **random YouTube video** appears, eerily matched to your desired time.
4. If it fails to find a video?  
   You get shamed, gently. And we link you to a **"Find your purpose in life"** quiz.

## 🧪 Why It Works

Built by humans during a "Useless Projects" Hackathon — but based on:

- **Neuroscience of Attention**
- **Hook Model (Nir Eyal)**
- **Copywriting from Mad Men era with AI help**

### 🧠 **Psychological Features**

#### **🎨 Visual Hijacking**
- **Custom neon cursor** with particle trails
- **Floating elements** that create visual discomfort
- **Gradient text** that shifts colors continuously
- **Glow effects** that demand attention

#### **⚡ Pattern Interrupts**
- **20% chance** to return completely wrong video duration
- **Scroll detection** triggers popup: "No. Stay. Waste time properly."
- **Idle detection** (30s) shows: "Are you *still* trying to be productive? 😩"

#### **🎯 Conversion Psychology**
- **PAS Formula**: "You've got 10 minutes. But zero self-control. Let us help."
- **AIDA Formula**: "Tired. Distracted. Desperate for delay. Press this."
- **Zeigarnik Effect**: Progress bar stops at 87% (never completes)

#### **🎪 Easter Eggs**
- **"PRODUCTIVITY MODE"** button that rickrolls
- **Confetti explosion** when video loads
- **Haptic feedback** on mobile devices
- **Secret productivity mode** that just rickrolls

## 👁‍🗨 Built With Love + No Productivity

Created at Tinkerspace's Useless Projects 2.0 Hackathon 🧠🪄

**Remember:** This isn't just a website. It's a **weaponized scroll delay machine** designed to make procrastination feel like an art form while secretly manipulating you into staying longer than intended.

---

## 🎭 The Science Behind the Madness

### **Dopamine Engineering**
- **Variable reward schedules** (random video durations)
- **Immediate feedback loops** (instant button responses)
- **Social proof** (fake progress indicators)
- **Loss aversion** (unfinished progress bars)

### **Attention Economics**
- **Visual salience** through neon contrast
- **Motion capture** with floating elements
- **Pattern interrupts** to break scrolling
- **Cognitive load reduction** (one big button)

### **Behavioral Psychology**
- **Anchoring** (suggested time formats)
- **Framing** ("waste time" vs "take a break")
- **Commitment consistency** (progress tracking)
- **Reciprocity** (free video recommendations)

3. Remember you have actual work to do
4. Consider seeking professional help for productivity issues

**But honestly, you probably won't.** 😈
